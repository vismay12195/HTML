    <!-- Assignment Question 1 -->
    <p>
    <h2> Are the HTML Tags and Elements the same thing? </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are closely related. <br><br> HTML tags are in
        the
        angle brackets which are used to identify elements and define their attributes. <br> for ex. &lt;img&gt; &nbsp;
        this tag is used to define the image. <br><br> Where as the elements, are the building blocks of HTML documents
        and
        consists of the start tag, content and an end tag. <br> for ex. &lt;p&gt;My name is Vismay Modi&lt;&frasl;p&gt;
        <br> Here &lt;p&gt; is a Start tag. "My name us Vismay Modi" is Content. And &lt;&frasl;p&gt;is an End tag.
        <br><br>
        In summary, tags are used to define the type of elements, while elements are made up of the tag(s) and the
        content that is enclosed between them.

    <p>
    <h2> What are Tags and Attributes in HTML? </h2>
    </p>
    <p> In HTML, the tags and Attributes are used to define the structure and appearance of the web pages. <br><br> Tags
        generally surround the content and provide the information regarding the content they surrounded. <br><br> Where
        as, Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element such as the size, color or behaviour
        of an element. <br><br> for ex. &lt;input <b>type</b>="text" <b>placeholder</b>="Enter your name"
        <b>required</b>&gt; <br> Here, &lt;input&gt; tag defines an input element, and attributes are type, placeholder
        and required which provide additional information about the input.

    <h2> What is the Class attribute in HTML? </h2>
    </p>
    <p> The <b>'class'</b> attribute is used to assign a specific class or classes to HTML elements. <br> &rightarrow; A
        class is a way of grouping similar elements together so that they can be targeted and styled with the same CSS
        rules as well. <br><br> for ex. <br> &lt;p <b>class</b>="my"&gt; This is my class. &lt;&frasl;p&gt; <br> &lt;p
        <b>class</b>="my"&gt; This is my second class. &lt;&frasl;p&gt; <br><br> Here, both the paragraphs have been
        assigned to the same class "my" using the 'class' attribute and it could be targeted using CSS to apply specific
        styles to both the paragraphs at once.

    <!-- Assignment Question 7 -->
    <p>
    <h2> What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements? </h2>
    </p>
    <p> Both the <b>'id'</b> attribute and the <b>'class'</b> attribute are used to assign specific names or identifiers
        to HTML elements, but they have different purposes. <br><br> The <b>'id'</b> attribute is used to uniquely
        identify a single element. Where as, the <b>'class'</b> attribute is used to group together multiple elements
        that share common styles or behaviors. <br><br> for ex. <br> &lt;section
        <b>class</b>="sauce"&gt;..... &lt;&frasl;section&gt; <br> &lt;div <b>id</b>="photo"&gt;..... &lt;&frasl;div&gt;
        <br><br> Here,<br>(1) where the class="sauce" is given, in that section or any other element that would be
        outside of that section in a program and defined with the same class(grouping), will accept all
        the styles and or behaviours given in CSS for that particular class. <br>(2) where the id="photo" is given that
        id is unique and no other
        element can have that same id in the program as any style or behavior defined in the CSS will be specifically
        applied to that element only and it won't be repeated on the same webpage with other elements again.

    <p> The main use of &lt;iframe&gt; tag is to embed external content such as videos, maps, social media,
        advertisements, and more from another website into the current web page. <br><br> It helps in creating an extra
        display screen or to open a webpage inside a webpage. <br><br> &lt;iframe&gt; tag can have security
        implications, because it could be used for phishing attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to only embed content
        from trusted sources. <br><br> for ex.&lt;iframe
        <b>src</b>="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?" <b>width</b>="1480" <b>height</b>="450" <b>style</b>="border:1;"

    <!-- Assignment Question 14 -->
    <p>
    <h2> What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example. </h2>
    </p>
    <p> HTML offers only two generic elements( &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;) which can be used to describe any text
        content which can not be explained
        with any of the existing HTML text elements. <br><br>Span indicates a word or phrase for which no text-level
        element currently exists. The generic elements are given meaning and context with the id and class
        attributes. <br><br> A span offers the same benefits as the <b>div</b> element, except it is <strong>used for
            phrase elements and does not introduce line breaks</strong>. Because spans are inline elements, they may
        contain only text and other inline elements (in other words, you cannot put headings, lists, content-grouping
        elements, and so on, in a span). <br><br> for ex. <br>&lt;section <b>class</b>="cooked"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &lt;label <b>for</b>="doneness"&gt;How do you want your bread
        cooked?&lt;&frasl;label&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Rare&lt;&frasl;span&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input
        <b>type</b>="range" <b>id</b>="doneness" <b>name</b>="doneness"
        <b>min</b>="0"
        <b>max</b>="5"
        <b>step</b>="0.5"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Well-done&lt;&frasl;span&gt;<br>&lt;&frasl;section&gt;<br><br>&rightarrow;<u>Output:</u><br>
    <section class="cooked">
        <label for="doneness">How do you want your bread cooked?</label>
        <br>
        <span>Rare</span>
        <input type="range" id="doneness" name="doneness" min="0" max="5" step="0.5">

        <span>Well-done</span>
    </section><br>Here in the example, Rare and Well-done have been printed using the &lt;span&gt;element which is
    making it easier to context them along with the &lt;input&gt;'s <b>type="Range" and id="doneness"</b> attribute.

    <h2> How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? </h2>
    </p>
    <p> The most common way to insert a picture into a background image of a web page in HTML is to write the
        <b>background</b> attribute in the body tag itself. In background attribute we can put a url from the internet
        or any downloaded image's path from the computer as a value in order for it to appear as the background
        image.<br><br> for ex. &lt;body <b>background</b>="URL/File Path from computer"&gt;

    <h2> How are active links different from normal links? </h2>
    </p>
    <p> In HTML, we can create the links using an anchor <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> element. <br> Firstly, on the web page the
        <b>Normal Link(Unvisited link)</b> is displayed in <b>Blue</b> color. <br>Secondly, as soon as we click on that
        link to
        go to the redirected page and come back to the main link back the color changes to Purple which indicates that
        the user has visited this link before. <br> Thirdly, <b>Active links</b>! These links turn in <b>Red</b> color
        and they
        show that the browser is in the process to load a new resource as soon as the user right clicks any of the
        visited or unvisited link. <br><br> for ex. &nbsp; &lt;a
        <b>href</b>="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear"&gt; Click here to go to Brown Bear Wikipedia
        &lt;&frasl;a&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> Click here to go to Brown
            Bear Wikipedia </a> <br>In the above link follow the steps as mentioned in the answer and the difference
        between the normal and active links would be easily visible.

        <p> Logical tags are tags that describe the structure and meaning of the content, without specifying how it
            should be displayed. <br><br>for ex. Heading tags(&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) ; Paragraph tag (&lt;p&gt;) ;
            Table tag(&lt;table&gt;) and more... <br> These tags provide meaning to the content and help screen readers
            to understand the content structure. </p>
        <li><u> Physical Tags: </u></li><br>
        <p> Physical tags are tags that describe how the content should be displayed on the screen.<br><br>for ex. Bold
            and strong tag(&lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;) ; Underline tag (&lt;u&gt; or &lt;ins&gt;) and many more...
            <br> These tags normally provide visual styling to the content.
